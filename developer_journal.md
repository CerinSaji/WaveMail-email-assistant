## Day 1: Foundation Setup Issues

### Challenge 1: Tailwind CSS PostCSS Plugin Configuration Error
**Problem**: React app failed to compile with Tailwind CSS due to PostCSS plugin configuration issues.

**Error Encountered**:
```
Compiled with problems: Ã— ERROR in ./src/index.css 
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js): 
Error: It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS 
you'll need to install @tailwindcss/postcss and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

**Solution**:
Installed the separate @tailwindcss/postcss package and updated the postcss.config.js file to use the correct plugin configuration. The standard tailwindcss plugin configuration in PostCSS resolved the compilation error.

**Key Learnings**:
- Tailwind CSS plugin structure changed in recent versions
- Always check PostCSS configuration when CSS compilation fails
- The error message provides clear guidance for the fix

### Challenge 2: Supabase Client Connection Error
**Problem**: Supabase Python client connection failed with proxy-related errors and SDK initialization issues.

**Error Encountered**:
```python
{"status":"error","message":"Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'"}
```

**Solution**:
Switched from using the Supabase Python SDK client to direct HTTP calls using httpx AsyncClient. Implemented REST API calls to Supabase with proper headers (apikey and Authorization) to bypass SDK compatibility issues.

**Key Learnings**:
- SDK client libraries can have compatibility issues in certain environments
- Direct REST API calls provide more control and reliability
- HTTP clients like httpx offer good alternatives when SDKs fail
- Always implement fallback connection methods for critical integrations

## Resources

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Clear npm cache if CSS issues persist
npm cache clean --force

# Rebuild node_modules
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check Supabase connection
python -c "from supabase import create_client; print('Supabase import successful')"
```
